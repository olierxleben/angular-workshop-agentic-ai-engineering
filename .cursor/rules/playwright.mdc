description: Guide to write reliable and stable tests with playwright

## Test Ids

- Prefer selecting elements with `data-testid`
- If no `data-testid` is present, add `data-testid` with a corresponding id to the template of the respective Angular Component template

## Test Scope

- Only test what is asked for
- Be as concise as possible

## Test description

- use plain `test`-Method without describe
- Write test description in Gherkin syntax (see example)

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test(`
  Given a list of books
  When typing database in the search
  Then it shows at least one search result
`, () => {
  // ..
});
```
